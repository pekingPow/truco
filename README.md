# Truco!

## Jingle

From the fields of Galicia, through the South of America, the favorite card game is... TRUCO!

## Summary

Truco is a card game originally from Spain and popular in South America. It is played using a Spanish deck. Two people may play, or two teams of two.

## Overview

Truco has many local versions in Uruguay, Argentina, and Venezuela, among other Southern nations. This project starts with simple and general rules, with plans to incorporate more details over time. The ultimate goal is to offer several versions of Truco, preserving this South American tradition for future generations!

## About the Project Leader

Juan Dager (@pekingPow) has extensive experience playing various versions of Truco, with a preference for the Venezuelan version.

## Game Philosophy

Truco is a game of deception and strategy. This project aims to capture the fun, spice, and friction that make Truco exciting.

## Cultural Note

Truco is infamously banned in some universities, except in a few areas of tolerance. The game attracts a spice of nuanced vulgarity that one must experience in person to understand.

In some circles, players bet money, and in extreme cases, fights have started and ended badly because of a hand of Truco.

The DevTeam encourages players to approach the game with a sense of fun and respect.
